# Code Quiz Challenge

The Code Quiz Challenge is a web application designed to test your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. It provides a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. Incorrect answers result in time deduction from the countdown timer. At the end of the quiz, you can save your initials and score to the high score leaderboard.
